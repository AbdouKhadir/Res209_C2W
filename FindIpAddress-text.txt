      Sample Protocol Specification:  FindIpAddress (Text Version)

Abstract

   Sample protocol specification for the binary version of the
   FineIpAddress protocol.  The goal of this protocol is to allow a
   client to query a server to find the IP address corresponding to a
   given name.  This an overly-simplified protocol which is only meant
   as a simple example.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of the FindIpAddress protocol is to allow clients to find
   the IP address that corresponds to a given name.  Each client MUST
   know the IP address and corresponding port number of at least one
   instance of a FindIpAddress server.

   For the sake of simplicity, the message format is the same for all
   the messages.

   Clients can use either UDP or TCP to exchange messages with a server.
   When sending a reply, the server MUST use the same layer four
   protocol used by the client for the corresponding request.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Message Format

   All messages have the same format:

           <IP Address> CRLF
           <Name> CRLF

   Where CR represents the ASCII character "Carriage Return" (13) and LF
   represents the ASCII character "Line Feed" (10). <Name> is the name
   for which the client would like to find the corresponding IP address.
   In a request <IP Address> MUST be '0' (without the quotation marks).
   In a positive response <IP Address> MUST contain the dotted decimal
   representation of the IP address (e.g., 135.34.231.3).  In a negative
   response <IP Address> MUST contain '0' (again without the quotation
   marks).

   The server MUST always reply to a request, either with a positive
   response (in this case the IP Address field contains the IP address
   corresponding to the name requested by the client) or with a negative
   response (in this case the IP Address field MUST be set to 0).


3.  Reliability

   When using UDP, a client MAY resend a request for which it has not
   yet received a response after a certain time.  In order not to
   overload servers, clients SHOULD wait at least 2 seconds before

   resending a request.


4.  Server Configuration and Multiple Servers

   Each server MUST maintain a local data base mapping names to IP
   addresses.  If a server does not find a certain name in its local
   data base, instead of immediately sending a negative response, the
   server MAY contact one or more other servers, asking if they know the
   IP address corresponding to the name requested by the client.  Upon
   receiving a response the server should forward it to the
   corresponding client.  Note that in this case it is up to the server
   to resend the request to another server, if it has not received a
   response after a certain time.


5.  Examples

   Suppose a client would like to know the IP address corresponding to
   the computer1.example.com name.  It should send the following message
   to the server (recall that CR represents the ASCII character
   "Carriage Return" (13) and LF represents the ASCII character "Line
   Feed" (10)):

       0CRLF
       computer1.example.comCRLF

   If the IP address of the computer1.example.com name is 34.23.44.1,
   the server MUST respond with the following message:

       34.23.44.1CRLF
       computer1.example.comCRLF

   If, instead, the requested name does not exist, the server MUST
   respond with the following message:

       0CRLF
       computer1.example.comCRLF
